A completely fueled and well maintained Orbital Hubs United Dropship reaches a top speed of half a hex per second and 
has a save maximum reach of XXX Hexes.

Calculations and Tests in our lab have proven that maintaining this speed with 150kg cargo, the OhU Standardized Value 
for two crewmembers, uses YYY amount of OHU approved TrashMan Chemfuel.

The assisted Take-Off and Landing Process uses another ten to twenty seconds of fuel, depending on the terrain at your landing zone.

If the full cargo capacity of one metric ton is used, the OHU Dropship still uses only ZZZ of TrashMan Chemfuel per second. 


fixed :
speed (world tiles/second) x ( fuel (seconds) - 2 x localmap_offset (seconds) )= distance (world tiles)

2 seconds/worldTile = 1/2 worldTile/second
localmap_offset = either the average value or maximal value of travel on a local map during take off and landing. 

so for launching you allready know ( localmap.size - localmap.x ) as flightpath -> length/speed = times
while landing gives you localmap.x which remains as the only unknown value and should therefore default to max mapsize. 


X and Z are in actual coordinates in the cartesian 2d system. Y is the height of the object, so a negative value renders the turret 
underneath the plane, a positive or zero value above.
You can use floating numbers for this entry.
The other position offset defines the tile in which the turret will spawn.
